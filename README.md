# Debt Management App 

This is my first application built with React framework. 
It is still in progress, as I mostly use it as a React/Redux/Flux learning playground. 

# Description

It is a simple application that helps you to keep track of your debts. 

The dashboard shows how much you owe and in what currency. 
It also has a clock to remind and to make you uncomfortable about the fact 
that the clock is ticking and you're still not done with your debts! 

Also, it shows the daily currency exchange rates. 

Each time you made a transaction, you can add the amount and date through the dashboard. 
It will be saved in the transactions history with the last 10 transactions appearing on the screen.
